A Development Code also establishes standards for how land should be developed which helps promote orderly growth, reduces land use conflicts, protects property values, and supports the community's long-term vision. It is important to note that all uses of the land before the adoption of the development code will not be impacted. This iteration of the code only applies to development that occurs after its adoption.",
